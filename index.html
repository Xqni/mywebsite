      <h2>About me</h2><br>
      <p>I am curios person who wants to gain knowledge. I have tried couple of things in my 20-years of life such as video editing (anime video editor btw) - also did as a freelancing side hustle, two security jobs, a coorporate job (still doing it), two side businesses - you can find the link to one (my shop) on the top.<br>
      <br>
      Why did I go out of my way to do all this you might ask?
      <br><br>
      I heard this from someone that <b>you won't know if something is fit for you until you try it, and not just try but go all in.</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-thought">"Everything you are trying to do, someone has already done it. There is a blueprint to the things you want to achieve. To find that blueprint, you have to be willing to step out. <b>That is what means to grow!</b>"</div>

          <h2>Task Tracker</h2>
          <p>Python</p><br>
          <p>I made this simple, beginner Python project. This is a command line program which, as the name suggests, tracks user's tasks. Users can add, update, delete, list, and mark (done or in-progress) tasks using defined commands. I have also included a separate help text file which users can either go and read or use the help command to print all the text in the file to their terminal. Make sure to check it out using the link below.</p>

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <div class="hobbies-description">
      <p>As any other teenager I am a gamer, now I might not have played that many games to call myself a gamer but I have played couple. I also tap into the world of emotions. My hobbies are listed below with more details. However, they are just not limited to the ones listed, as you can see that I went as far as to make this website.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hobbies-container">
      <div class="hobby hobby-1">
        <h2>Valorant</h2>
        <p>Being an FPS being game, also my first ever FPS on PC, Valorant was like an addiction to me. I used to play it a lot, like crazy lot. I started playing Valorant back in pandemic when it recently came out, and have spent over 1000hrs in this game to this day.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="hobby hobby-2">
        <h2>Genshin Impact</h2>
        <p>Genshin Impact is an open world, free-to-play gacha game which uses a wish system for players to obtain new characters. It is one of my favorite games and will always be (I have spent around 10k on this game). Everything from world building to lore is absolute cinema. Although, as much as I love the game, I haven't been able to play it for the longest mainly because of other things going.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="hobby hobby-3">
        <h2>Anime</h2>
        <p>Anime, originating from Japan, has not only been entertaining but also inspirational and educational in my eyes. There are things that people learn by doing, making mistakes, and correcting themselves. However, there are times when something is just not making any sense and you feeling lost. I have been at that point and honestly I was able to pick up some really advise or perspectives from anime that also surprises me.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="hobby hobby-4">
        <h2>Knowledge</h2>
        <p>Yes, knowledge, there are so many things in this world that are still unknown to me and don't make sense. For example, why even after the fact that people know what should be done in a certain situation don't do it? Why do rich people continue to grow rich? What is the purpose of the life I have been given?
        <br>
        There are several hundreds and thousands of these questions and I am not even sure if I will be able to find answers to them in this lifetime. This every fact keeps intrigued and curious.
