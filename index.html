      <h2>About me</h2><br>
      <p>I am curios person who wants to know so many things. I have tried couple of things in my 20-years of life such as video editing (anime video editor btw) - also did as a freelancing side hustle, two security jobs, a coorporate job (still doing it), two side businesses - you can find the link to one (my shop) on the top.<br>
      <br>
      Why did I go out of my way to do all this you might ask?
      <br><br>
      I heard this from someone that you won't know if its for you until you try, and not just try but go all in.
